### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a PhD candidate in Informatics. Here you can find repos related to my research.

ðŸ”­ I am currently involved in two studies:
1. The design challenge study is looking at how pairs of software developers use LLMs to aid in software design. The sourcecode for the bot used to chat to LLMs is available.
2. In collaboration with other Universities, we are looking at how students code comprehension is impacted by the use of LLMs for writing code.
